<p>The Transition component lets you describe a transition from one component state to another over time with a simple declarative API. Most commonly it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also be used to describe in-place transition states as well.</p>

<p>When the in prop is set to true, the child component will first receive the class example-enter, then the example-enter-active will be added in the next tick. CSSTransition forces a reflow between before adding the example-enter-active. This is an important trick because it allows us to transition between example-enter and example-enter-active even though they were added immediately one after another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate appearance.</p>

<p>Here, useState is a Hook (we’ll talk about what this means in a moment). We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders. useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It’s similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together. (We’ll show an example comparing useState to this.state in Using the State Hook.)</p>

<p>The only argument to useState is the initial state. In the example above, it is 0 because our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike this.state, the state here doesn’t have to be an object — although it can be if you want. The initial state argument is only used during the first render.</p>
